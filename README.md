# Password-hash-decryption
A basic python program to unhash those hashes.

Update 1.0

The python based file currently runs a shell where you will input the hash, the hashing algorithm and all the wordlists you want to try it with.
The wordlists function lets you input the path to as many as you want.
When you are finished inputting your wordlists into the script, leave blank the the program will begin to compare the hash to other hashes in the wordlists.

Sha1/Sha256 and md5 are supported at the moment

Update 1.0.1

- Added a percntage counter to calculate and give the user an idea of how far into the wordlist the program has gone into.
- Added a password hasher interface to then assist with getting a hash for a given text.
